The FeedHQ API
==============

FeedHQ implements the Google Reader API. This document, while being FeedHQ's
API documentation, aims to be a reference for developers seeking information
about the details of this API.

The Google Reader API was never publicly released or documented but developers
have reverse-engineered it and built an ecosystem of applications that use
this API implementation for syncing mobile or desktop apps with Google Reader
accounts.

A handful of resources are available in various places of the internet but
it's tedious for developers to get an accurate and extensive idea of how the
API works. This is FeedHQ's attempt to fix that.
